# funannotate

* **NOTE:** I am not a part of the devlopment and maintenance of funannotate. For this, see the [funnannotate repo](https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate) by Jon Palmer.*
  
**What is this?** A repo for my notes on installing funannotate, its dependencies, the work-arounds, and running the funannotate pipeline. Here I hope to compile my notes for constructing a functional pipeline for genome annotation.
